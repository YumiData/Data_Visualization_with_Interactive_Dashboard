# Data Manipulation and Visualization

## Project Overview
Kickstarter is a crowdfunding platform that aims to "help bring creative projects to life". The data was originally from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kemical/kickstarter-projects?resource=download.
This project focuses on data manipulation and visualization to extract meaningful insights from complex datasets. The goal is to develop an interactive dashboard, making it easier for users to understand and interact with the data.

## Procedure of Dashboard Creation
* Data Collection and Preparation: standardize, clean, and preprocess the data for analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis: conduct initial analysis to understand data characteristics
* Feature Engineering: enhance data features for more effective analysis
* Dashboard Development: create an intuitive and user-friendly interface
* Implementing Interactivity: integrate interactive elements for dynamic data exploration

## Result
Supports informed decision-making by presenting complex data in an accessible format
